Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internet et la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyens qui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif ou de divertissement, indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot de défis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dans la nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que le cadre réglementaire européen relatif au droit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance et les investissements dans notre économie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle. Cette consultation s’adresse   différentes catégories de parties prenantes. Dans la mesure du possible, il est indiqué quelle(s) catégorie(s) de personnes interrogées est (sont) la (les) plus susceptible(s) d’être concernée(s) pour chaque question (annotation entre parenthèses, en début de question). Les personnes interrogées ne doivent cependant pas hésiter   répondre   n’importe quelle question/  toutes les questions. Veuillez également noter qu’  l’exception de la question relative   l’identification des personnes interrogées, aucune question n’est obligatoire.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders. To the extent possible, the questions indicate the category/ies of respondents most likely to be concerned by them (annotation in brackets, before the actual question). Respondents should nevertheless feel free to reply to any/all of the questions. Also, please note that, apart from the question concerning the identification of the respondent, none of the questions is obligatory.

Responses may, however, be sent in any of the 24 official languages of the EU.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internet et la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyensqui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif ou de divertissement,indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot dedéfis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dans la nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que le cadre réglementaire européenrelatif audroit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance et les investissements dans notre économie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle. Cette consultation s’adresse   différentes catégories de parties prenantes. Dans la mesure du possible, il est indiqué quelle(s) catégorie(s)de personnes interrogéesest (sont) la (les) plus susceptible(s) d’être concernée(s) pour chaque question (annotation entre parenthèses, en début de question). Les personnes interrogées ne doivent cependant pas hésiter   répondre   n’importe quelle question/  toutes les questions. Veuillez également noter qu’  l’exception de la question relative  l’identificationdes personnes interrogées, aucune question n’est obligatoire. Les réponses ne répondant qu’  une partie des questions seront également acceptées. La consultation publique est disponible en anglais. Néanmoins, les réponses peuvent être soumises dans n’importe laquelle des 24 langues officielles de l’Union européenne. Les contributions reçues   cette consultation seront publiées sur le site de la DG MARKT, ainsi qu’un rapport de synthèse présentant les réponses sous la forme de données statistiques et agrégées. Veuillez noter que toutes les contributions reçues seront publiées avec mention de l’identité du contributeur, sauf si celui-ci s’oppose   la publication de ses données personnelles au motif que cela porterait préjudice   ses intérêts légitimes. Dans ce cas, la contribution sera publiée sous une forme anonyme,   la demande expresse du contributeur. Sinon, la contribution ne sera pas publiée et son contenu ne sera pas pris en compte dans le rapport de synthèse.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internetet la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyens qui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif oude divertissement, indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot de défis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dansla nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que lecadre réglementaire européen relatif au droit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance etles investissements dans notre économie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle. Cette consultation s’adresse   différentes catégories de parties prenantes. Dans la mesure du possible, il est indiqué quelle(s) catégorie(s) de personnes interrogées est (sont) la (les) plus susceptible(s) d’être concernée(s) pour chaque question (annotation entre parenthèses, en début de question). Les personnes interrogées ne doivent cependant pas hésiter   répondre   n’importe quelle question/  toutes les questions. Veuillez également noter qu’  l’exception de la question relative   l’identification des personnes interrogées, aucune question n’est obligatoire. Les réponses ne répondant qu’  une partie des questions seront également acceptées. Les contributions reçues   cette consultation seront publiées sur le site de la DG MARKT, ainsi qu’un rapport de synthèse présentant les réponses sous la forme de données statistiques et agrégées. Veuillez noter que toutes les contributions reçues seront publiées avec mention de l’identité du contributeur, sauf si celui-ci s’oppose   la publication de ses données personnelles au motif que cela porterait préjudice   ses intérêts légitimes. Dans ce cas, la contribution sera publiée sous une forme anonyme,   la demande expresse du contributeur. Sinon, la contribution ne sera pas publiée et son contenu ne sera pas pris en compte dans le rapport de synthèse.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internet et la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyensqui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif ou de divertissement,indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot dedéfis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dans la nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que le cadre réglementaire européenrelatif audroit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance et les investissements dans notre économie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle. Cette consultation s’adresse   différentes catégories de parties prenantes. Dans la mesure du possible, il est indiqué quelle(s) catégorie(s)de personnes interrogéesest (sont) la (les) plus susceptible(s) d’être concernée(s) pour chaque question (annotation entre parenthèses, en début de question).

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internet et la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyensqui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif ou de divertissement,indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot dedéfis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dans la nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que le cadre réglementaire européenrelatif audroit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance et les investissements dans notre économie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders. To the extent possible, the questions indicate the category/ies of respondents most likely to be concerned by them (annotation in brackets, before the actual question). Respondents should nevertheless feel free to reply to any/all of the questions.

Replies containing answers only to part of the questions will be also accepted. The public consultation is available in English. Responses may, however, be sent in any of the 24 official languages of the EU.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internet et la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyens qui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif ou de divertissement, indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot de défis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dans la nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que le cadre réglementaire européen relatif au droit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance et les investissements dans notreéconomie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle. Cette consultation s’adresse   différentes catégories de partiesprenantes. Dans la mesure du possible, il est indiqué quelle(s) catégorie(s) de personnes interrogées est (sont) la (les) plus susceptible(s) d’être concernée(s) pour chaque question (annotation entre parenthèses, en début de question). Les personnes interrogées ne doivent cependant pas hésiter   répondre   n’importe quelle question/  toutes les questions. Veuillez également noter qu’  l’exception de la question relative   l’identification des personnes interrogées, aucune question n’est obligatoire. Les réponses ne répondant qu’  une partie des questions seront également acceptées. La consultation publique est disponible en anglais. Néanmoins, les réponses peuvent être soumises dans n’importelaquelle des 24 langues officielles de l’Union européenne. Les contributions reçues   cette consultation seront publiées sur le site de la DG MARKT, ainsi qu’un rapport de synthèse présentant les réponses sous la forme de données statistiques et agrégées. Veuillez noter que toutes les contributions reçues seront publiées avec mention de l’identité du contributeur, sauf si celui-ci s’oppose   la publication de ses données personnelles au motif que cela porterait préjudice   ses intérêts légitimes. Dans ce cas, la contribution sera publiée sous une forme anonyme,   la demande expresse du contributeur. Sinon, la contribution ne sera pas publiée et son contenu ne sera pas pris en compte dans le rapport de synthèse.

Během posledních dvou desetiletí se díky digitální technologii a internetu změnilyzpůsoby tvorby, distribuce a zpřístupňování obsahu. Těm, kdo tvoří a produkují obsah (např. film, román, píseň), se naskýtají nové možnostia příležitosti. A totéž platí pro nové i dosavadnídistribuční platformy, pro instituce typu knihoven, pro činnosti,jakojenapř.výzkum,i pro občany, kteří dnes počítají s tím, žek obsahubudou mít přístup – pro informační, vzdělávací i zábavní účely – bez ohledu na zeměpisné hranice.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders. To the extent possible, the questions indicate the category/ies of respondents most likely to be concerned by them (annotation in brackets, before the actual question). Respondents should nevertheless feel free to reply to any/all of the questions. Also, please note that, apart from the question concerning the identification of the respondent, none of the questions is obligatory. Replies containing answers only to part of the questions will be also accepted. The public consultation is available in English. Responses may, however, be sent in any of the 24 official languages of the EU. The contributions received in this round of consultation as well as a summary report presenting the responses in a statistical and aggregated form will be published on the website of DG MARKT. Please note that all contributions received will be published together with the identity of the contributor, unless the contributor objects to the publication of their personal data on the grounds that such publication would harm his or her legitimate interests. In this case, the contribution will be published in anonymous form upon the contributor's explicit request.

Au cours des vingt dernières années, Internet et la technologie numérique ont remodelé les processus de création, de distribution et d’accès aux contenus. De nouvelles opportunités se sont présentées pour ceux qui créent et produisent du contenu (un film, un roman ou une chanson, par exemple), pour les nouvelles plateformes de distribution comme pour les anciennes, pour les institutions telles que les bibliothèques, pour les activités comme la recherche, et pour les citoyens qui entendent désormais pouvoir accéder   du contenu informatif, éducatif ou de divertissement, indépendamment des frontières géographiques. Ce nouvel environnement comporte également son lot de défis. Le marché devra par exemple continuer   s’adapter   de nouveaux modes de distribution et d’utilisation. Un autre défi réside dans la nécessité, pour le législateur, de s’assurer que le système de droits, de limitations et d’application de ces droits reste adéquat et soit adapté   ce nouvel environnement. La présente consultation se concentre sur ce deuxième défi : veiller   ce que le cadre réglementaire européen relatif au droit d’auteur reste en adéquation avec ses objectifs dans l’environnement numérique, afin de soutenir la création et l’innovation, d’exploiter pleinement le potentiel du marché unique, de favoriser la croissance et les investissements dans notre économie et de promouvoir la diversité culturelle. Cette consultation s’adresse   différentes catégories de parties prenantes. Dans la mesure du possible, il est indiqué quelle(s) catégorie(s) de personnes interrogées est (sont) la (les) plus susceptible(s) d’être concernée(s) pour chaque question (annotation entre parenthèses, en début de question). Les personnes interrogées ne doivent cependant pas hésiter   répondre   n’importe quelle question/  toutes les questions. Veuillez également noter qu’  l’exception de la question relative   l’identification des personnes interrogées, aucune question n’est obligatoire. Les réponses ne répondant qu’  une partie des questions seront également acceptées. La consultation publique est disponible en anglais. Néanmoins, les réponses peuvent être soumises dans n’importe laquelle des 24 langues officielles de l’Union européenne. Les contributions reçues   cette consultation seront publiées sur le site de la DG MARKT, ainsi qu’un rapport de synthèse présentant les réponses sous la forme de données statistiques et agrégées. Veuillez noter que toutes les contributions reçues seront publiées avec mention de l’identité du contributeur, sauf si celui-ci s’oppose   la publication de ses données personnelles au motif que cela porterait préjudice   ses intérêts légitimes. Dans ce cas, la contribution sera publiée sous une forme anonyme,   la demande expresse du contributeur. Sinon, la contribution ne sera pas publiée et son contenu ne sera pas pris en compte dans le rapport de synthèse.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders. To the extent possible, the questions indicate the category/ies of respondents most likely to be concerned by them (annotation in brackets, before the actual question). Respondents should nevertheless feel free to reply to any/all of the questions. Also, please note that, apart from the question concerning the identification of the respondent, none of the questions is obligatory. Replies containing answers only to part of the questions will be also accepted. The public consultation is available in English. Responses may, however, be sent in any of the 24 official languages of the EU. The contributions received in this round of consultation as well as a summary report presenting the responses in a statistical and aggregated form will be published on the website of DG MARKT.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created,distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment.

New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

The"Licences for Europe"process has been finalised now. The Commission welcomes the practical solutions stakeholders have put forward in thiscontext and will monitor their progress. Pledges have been made by stakeholders in all four Working Groups (cross border portability of services, user-generated content,audiovisual andfilm heritage and text and data mining). Taken together, the Commission expects these pledgesto bea further step in making the user environment easier in many different situations. The Commission also takes note of the fact that two groups –user-generated content andtext and data mining–did not reach consensus among participating stakeholders on either the problems to be addressed or on the results. Thediscussions andresults of"Licences for Europe"will be also taken into account in the context of the review of the legislative framework. This consultation builds on previous consultations and public hearings, in particular those on the"Green Paper on copyright in the knowledge economy", the"Green Paper on the onlinedistribution of audiovisual works"and"Content Online". These consultations provided valuable feedback from stakeholders on a number of questions,on issues as diverse as the territoriality of copyright and possible ways to overcome territoriality, exceptions related to the online dissemination of knowledge, and rightholders’ remuneration, particularly in the audiovisual sector. Views were expressed by stakeholders representing all stages in the value chain, including right holders, distributors, consumers, and academics. The questions elicited widely diverging views on the best way to proceed. The "Green Paper on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy" was followed up by a Communication. The replies to the "Green Paper on the online distribution of audiovisual works" have fed into subsequent discussions on the Collective Rights Management Directive and into the current review process.

This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders.

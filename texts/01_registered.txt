Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content is created, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adapt to new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapid progress was deemed necessary and possible. This consultation is addressed to different categories of stakeholders.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

Over the last two decades, digital technology and the Internet have reshaped the ways in which content iscreated, distributed, and accessed. New opportunities have materialised for those that create and produce content (e.g. a film, a novel, a song), for new and existing distribution platforms, for institutions such as libraries, for activities such as research and for citizens who now expect to be able to access content – for information, education or entertainment purposes – regardless of geographical borders. This new environment also presents challenges. One of them is for the market to continue to adaptto new forms of distribution and use. Another one is for the legislator to ensure that the system of rights, limitations to rights and enforcement remains appropriate and is adapted to the new environment. This consultation focuses on the second of these challenges: ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity. on the one hand, to complete its on-going effort to review and to modernise the EU copyright legislative frameworkon the other, to facilitate practical industry-led solutions through the stakeholder dialogue "Licences for Europe" on issues on which rapidprogress was deemed necessary and possible.

ï‚ YES â€“ Please explainwhat type of measureswould be needed in order to address such problems (e.g. facilitation of joint licences when the rights are in different hands,legislation to achieve the "bundling of rights") xNO Jede legislative Intervention, die im Rahmen der reproduction rights oder der making available rights die Vertragsfreiheit der beteiligten Parteien behindert, kann fÃ¼r die weitere Entwicklung nur schÃ¤dlich sein und ist weder notwendig noch gerechtfertigt. Im B2B-Bereich ist das Rechteclearing fÃ¼r jeden professionell Agierenden inhaltlich vergleichsweise eine banale und selbstverstÃ¤ndliche TÃ¤tigkeit. Jeder sonstige Verwaltungsakt ist in Wirklichkeit komplizierter, da im Gegensatz dazu im Urheberrechtsbereich in vielen FÃ¤llen die Rechtehalter bekannt sind oder die Rechte ohnehin vonVerwertungsgesellschaften(mit Gebietsmonopol)wahrgenommen werden. Die einzigen Probleme, die sich fÃ¼r den interessierten Rechterwerber natÃ¼rlich stellen, sind monetÃ¤rer Natur, sprich Lizenzkosten. Dort, wo Verwertungsgesellschaften zustÃ¤ndig sind, agieren sie ohnehin bereits de facto auf territorialer Ebene als one-stop-shop. Dass mehrere Typen von Rechten fÃ¼r Verwertungen notwendig sind, ist im urheberrechtlichen Bereich ja nicht die Ausnahme, sondern der Regelfall: Jedes Musiklabel erwirbt z.B. selbstverstÃ¤ndlich Verbreitungs-, VerÃ¶ffentlichungs-, VervielfÃ¤ltigungs- und Sync-rechte, teilweise auch Bearbeitungsrechte. Das Nebeneinander des Rechteerwerbs von verschiedenen Rechten zu einem, in Ã¶konomischer Hinsicht gesehen einheitlichen Verwertungsakt ist also Standard. ï‚ NO OPINION Hyperlinks are references to data that lead a user from one location in the Internet to another. They are indispensable for the functioning of the Internet as a network. Severalcasesare pending before the CJEUin which the question has been raised whether the provision of aÂ clickable link constitutes an act of communication to the public/making available to the public subject to the authorisation of the rightholder. A user browsing the internet (e.g. viewing a web-page) regularly creates temporary copies of works and other subject-matter protected under copyright on the screen and in the 'cache' memory of his computer. A question has been referred to the CJEUas towhether such copies are always covered by the mandatory exception for temporary acts of reproduction provided for in Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29/EC.

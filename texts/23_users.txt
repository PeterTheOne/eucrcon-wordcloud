Je ne crois pas qu'aucun auteur/crÃ©ateur (je parle en tant que dessinatrice) n'a une idÃ©e prÃ©cise de ce que devient son oeuvre une foissortie de son territoire. Il serait bon d'harmoniser tout Ã§a, afin que les acteurs de la crÃ©ation soient protÃ©gÃ©s. Alors actuelle, les crÃ©ateurs/auteurs/compositeurs/etc. sont les maillons les plus vulnÃ©rables de la chaÃ®ne de la culture : les moins payÃ©s,les moins considÃ©rÃ©s, ceux qui ont le moins de droits et qui sont le moins soutenus. Il serait bien que la lÃ©gislation prenne la mesure de leur prÃ©caritÃ© et qu'Ã  titre europÃ©en et territorial, les crÃ©ateurs puissent savoir ce qu'il advient de leur crÃ©ation et la maniÃ¨re de la protÃ©ger (simple, tout peut Ãªtre simple, si la loi le veut bien) et la nature de leurs droits. Chaque parent peut protÃ©ger son enfant, il devrait en Ãªtre de mÃªme pour les crÃ©ateurs et leur crÃ©ation. Nous avons besoin de lois unifiÃ©esqui jouent en notre faveur et non pas contre nous pour dÃ©fendre l'intÃ©rÃªt de grands groupes ou d'industries.

El reconocimiento de la autorÃ­a de una obra es un derecho moral intransferible, inalienable e intemporal. Debe distinguirse muy bien entre el derecho de autor y el derecho de explotaciÃ³n, de la obra. El autor debe decidir a quiÃ©n desea transferir sus derechos de explotaciÃ³n. Los derechos de explotaciÃ³n no deben poder ser transferidos a terceros sin la autorizaciÃ³n del autor, ya que este tambiÃ©n es un derecho moral del autor, el decidir cÃ³mo desea difundir su obra. DeberÃ­a considerarse abusiva cualquier clÃ¡usula en la que se establezca la posibilidad de cesiones de derechos de difusiÃ³n/explotaciÃ³n a terceros sin identificar (genÃ©rico).

make a bullet point, simple, easy tounderstand, outline of what this is all about. let people who are not keen to "complex" legal language, and quite many are not native speakers of english nor french, to understand what this is all about.

Is it so out of budget to have this translated for each country's citizens to equally understand?????

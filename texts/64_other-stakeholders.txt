Uses of content, including cross-border, are regularly and successfully dealt with by negotiated licences.

Find below positions on Open access and content mining as highlighted in Question 32: Open access to research results: The Commission Recommendation of 17 July 2012 on access to and preservation of scientific information, promotes the adoption by Member States of policies that provide for thestorage of the results of publicly funded research, in online, open and free electronic infrastructures, which should be interoperable within and outside the EU and suitable for long term preservation. Academic and research libraries are directly involvedin such activities: they are often responsible of their parent institutional open access repositories. Other EU Recommendations require the open access availability of articles and other publications which are the result of publicly financed research, nolater than six months after their publication. Some publishers allow this practice to all their authors, others allow libraries to deposit just after long negotiations, but the majority oppose clear refusal. There should be a legal instrument enforcing â€“ on one side - the right of authors in making their papers available to the public for research and non-commercial purpose, and â€“ on the other side - the right of libraries or their parent institutions in collecting and making openly and publicly available such content Content mining: The potential of text and data mining for scientific research is enormous, and has been widely demonstrated. It is a process aimed to collect raw data (e.g., the occurrence of words, figures etc. in a database), not creative expressions. Libraries are interested in such utilization both for integrating content and metadata in their catalogues and information systems, and for the benefit of their users. Undertaking text and data mining of content to which researchers have alreadylawful access (i.e. when a lawful user is recognized as such by a voluntary licence (provided by the copyright holder) OR a legal licence (exception provided by law). See recitals 34,49,50,51 of the Preamble of the Directive 96/9/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases) should be considered a legitimate utilization, and should not be subject to re-license. But there is not legal certainty on this point, and most standard licences do not allow content mining. As a consequence, in most cases researchers give up research, rather than addressing high transaction cost, both direct (cost of re-licensing) and indirect (the time needed to negotiate). For this, an exception should explicitly legitimate text and data mining on content on which researchers have lawful access. Directive 2001/29/ECprovides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with aÂ disability. The open formulation ofthis (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union). The Marrakesh Treatyhas been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled.

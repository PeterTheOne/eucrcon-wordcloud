Directive 2001/29/ECprovides for an exception/limitation for the benefit of people with aÂ disability. The openformulation of this (optional) provision allows for rather different implementations at Member States level. At EU and international level projects have been launched to increase the accessibility of works and other subject-matter for persons with disabilities (notably by increasing the number of works published in special formats and facilitating their distribution across the European Union). The Marrakesh Treatyhas been adopted to facilitate access to published works for persons who are blind,visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. The Treaty creates a mandatory exception to copyright that allows organisations for the blind to produce, distribute and make available accessible format copies to visually impaired persons without the authorisation of the rightholders. The EU and its Member States have started work to sign and ratify the Treaty. This may require the adoption of certain provisions at EU level (e.g. to ensure the possibility to exchange accessible format copies across borders).

As far as I know, there is new legislation in Germany which allows researchers to publish their manuscripts freely online one year after publication in a journal. However, this is restricted to researchers in particular institutions. As I argued for 48., there is no need for a one year moratorium as the value added by the "publisher" is not publication of the manuscript, but inclusion of it in a list of evaluated works (the journal).
